</head>

    <h2>Genes and Statin Sensitivity</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apoptosis / Cell Cycle Regulation:</strong> Genes that regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis could influence how cancer cells respond to statins, as statins can induce cell cycle arrest and promote apoptosis in cancer cells.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Autophagy & DNA Repair:</strong> Genes involved in autophagy and DNA repair mechanisms are crucial for maintaining cellular health and can impact the efficacy of statins by affecting cellular responses to damage and stress.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Metabolism:</strong> This includes genes involved in the metabolism of drugs and other metabolic processes that statins can influence, such as cholesterol biosynthesis and energy metabolism. Statins affect energy metabolism by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase; genes involved in cellular energy pathways could indirectly affect statin sensitivity.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Membrane Proteins & Endocytosis:</strong> Genes related to cellular uptake, including endocytosis, are directly relevant to how effectively cells internalize statins, impacting their sensitivity.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Kinases, Transcription Factors, and Protein Degradation:</strong> Genes in these categories can influence a wide range of cellular processes, including those relevant to statin sensitivity, through the regulation of protein synthesis, modification, and degradation.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cell Adhesion & Signaling:</strong> Genes that affect cell adhesion and extracellular signaling can influence cancer metastasis and the tumor microenvironment, potentially impacting statin sensitivity. Includes genes within signaling pathways that could target or indirectly affect the drug pathway, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, which are involved in cell growth and survival.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cytoskeleton & Microtubules:</strong> These genes are involved in intracellular transport and cell division, affecting signaling molecule transport and cell proliferation.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Inflammation & Immune Modulation:</strong> Genes that modulate the immune response and inflammation can influence the tumor microenvironment, potentially affecting cancer progression and treatment responses.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Ubiquitination & Protein Stability:</strong> This category includes genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, affecting protein levels within the cell and thereby influencing cell cycle, signal transduction, and transcription.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Gene expression:</strong> Genes impacting overall expression profiles can alter statin responses by changing key protein levels involved in metabolism, signaling, and drug resistance.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cell Survival/Proliferation:</strong> Directly linked to cancer cell growth, these genes are central to determining how effectively statins can induce cancer cell death or halt proliferation.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>None:</strong> Genes that, based on current knowledge, do not have a clear link to processes directly or indirectly affected by statins.</li>
    </ul>
